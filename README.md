# Control-Unit-Simulation-VHDL-
Microprocessor control unit simulation implemented in VHDL (Quartus).

This project simulates a simplified model of a Motorola CPU08 central processor unit controlled by input opcode where:

completecontrolunit : Contains assembled control unit .bdf and Quartus project
adder, controlunit, multitwo: Contains the individual components
